    "#### In  this  section,  we  introduce  a  new mining strategy, called stubborn mining, that strictly generalizes (and improves upon) the prior known selfish mining attacker, causing the rest of the network to waste its hashpower on  redundant  blocks.  The  selfish  mining  strategy,in  particular,  withholds  blocks  when  it  is  “in  the  lead” (when  it  has  created  a  private  chain  longer  than  that of  the  honest  network),  but  cooperates  with  the  honest network  when  it  falls  behind.  The  key  insight  behind  stubborn  mining  is  that the  attacker  should not give up so easily! Instead, the attacker can often increase profits  by  mining  on  its  private  chain  more  often,  even under circumstances where a selfish-mining attacker would succumb to the public chain. There are two types of state transitions in this state machine:\n",
    "\n",
    "* State  transitions  that  take  place  when  honest miner  finds  a  newblock. In this case, honest miner always announces the new block immediately.  At  this  point,  selfish miner  has  the  freedom  of performing  the  following  actions: \n",
    "    * If  selfish miner's  private chain is leading, Alice can decide whether and how many blocks  to  reveal  from  its  private  chain  to  Bob;  and  \n",
    "    * If selfish miner's  private  chain  is  sufficiently  behind honest miner's  chain, selfish miner may choose to abandon mining on its private chain and accept honest miner's chain. selfish miner's decision in this case will define  how  the   chain  will  transition  when  honest miner mines a next block.\n",
    "    \n",
    "* State  transitions  that  take  place  when  selfish miner  finds  a  newblock.  In  the  latter  case,  when  selfish miner  mines  a  nextblock, we assume that selfish miner may simply continue to mine on  its  own  private  chain.  Whether  selfish miner  immediately reveals  her  new  block  to  honest miner  depends  on  the  strategy and the current state.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Defining  Key  Parameters ##\n",
    "\n",
    "### *   Hashpower  of  attacker (alpha) \"α\" :  The  fraction  of the  total     hashpower controlled by the attacker. \n",
    "\n",

    "### *   Network  influence (gamma) \"γ\" : fraction of honest miner's network(in  terms  of  hashpower)  that  will  mine  on  selfish miner's block  when both honest and selfish miners release a block at (approximately) the same time resulting in an equal length fork.\n",
